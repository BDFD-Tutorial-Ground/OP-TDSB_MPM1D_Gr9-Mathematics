## About This Course

![commits](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/BDFD-Tutorial-Ground/TDSB_MPM1D_Gr9-Mathematics?label=Last%20Commit%20)

The goal of Ontario Secondary School is to support high-quality learning while giving individual students the oppportunity to choose programs that suit their skills and interests. The updated Ontario curriculum, in combination with a broader range of learning options outside traditional classroom instruction, will enable student to better customize their high school education and improve their prospects for success in school and in lifes.

This repo provides a framework outlining what students are expected to know and be able to do by the end fo each of courses in Grade 9 mathematics curriculum. The require knwoledge and skills include not only important mathematical facts and procedures but also the mathematical concepts students need to understand and the mathematical processes they must laern to apply

**Course prerequisite**

- [x] **None**

**Course Learning Objectives**  
The principles underlying this curriculum are shared by educators dedicated to the success of all students in learning mathematics. Those principles can be stated as follows:

- Curriculum expectations must be coherent, focused, and well-articulated across the grades
- Learning Mathematics involves the meaningful acquistion of concepts, skills, and processes and the active involvement of students in building new knowledge from prior knowledge and experience
- Learning tools such as manipulatives and technologies are important supports for teaching and learning mathematics
- Effective teaching of mathematics requires that the teacher understand the mathematical concepts, procedures, and processes that students need to learn, and use a variety of instructional strategies to support meaningful learning
- Assessment and evaluation must support learning, recongnizing that students learn and demonstate learning in various ways
